1. Also you can download latest wordpress content and paste inside the src folder.

Instead of WordPress asking for FTP credentials to install themes and plugins, we can update src/wp-config.php as shown below.

....
....
/* Add any custom values between this line and the "stop editing" line. */

define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );
define( 'UPLOADS', 'wp-content/uploads' );

/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */
....
....
Also, change the directory permissions as shown below:

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data <path to src>/wp-content
These changes will allow us to install themes, plugins, and upload files on the linux systems.
